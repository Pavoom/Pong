#REPORT: Project 1 - Pong
*Aim*: Make a 2 player game with 2 paddles, a ball, 2 goals, 2 walls and a scoreboard.
*Requirements*: 
    Objects:2 box objects for paddles, 1 sphere or a box for ball, 2 boxes for walls, 2 more boxes for goals, an array of boxes for the mid-line. [Walls and goals can be made created my limiting coordinates of the ball and by scripting the behaviour of the ball when that limit is approached.]
    Scripts: One script for controlling the 2 paddles, one script for moving the ball, one script for recording the score.
*Progress*: Ball and its movement, paddles and their controls, walls and how to make the ball bounce off of them, goal objects.
*To do*: End the game when the ball collides with a goal, add scoreboard, add buttons/keys to start the game, pause the game and resume the game (probably /space/ for all 3), a start screen and replay screen.
